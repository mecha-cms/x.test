This extension contains `abort()` and `test()` functions that were previously available in the core application. They
have been separated from the core because they are not needed in a production site. Separating them into their own
extension also means that you can provide alternative test utilities with the same function names so that previous users
can continue to use them. To do this, simply remove this extension and then replace it with the other one that also
contains `abort()` and `test()` functions.
